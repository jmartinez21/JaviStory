There once was a unkindled knight named Florp.
His goal was to purloin the ashes from the remaining four Lords of Cinder.
After the treacherous paths to get to the Lords, Florp managed to slay them all, and claim their ashes.
He took their ashes to the first flame, and relinked the fire.
However, the first flame does not act as expected. It disappears, and everything turns back into chaos.
After the world had returned to chaos, Florp realized that he must once again set out to slay the four lords and reclaim the ash.
"God damn it, agian?" Florp smashes his helmet to the ground. He is tired, his sword is dull, and his shield is half broken.
